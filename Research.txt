    Deep transfer with related stock information (DTRSI) to predict stock price movement, to mitigate the
overfitting problem caused by an insufficient number of training samples, and to improve prediction
performance by using the relationships between stocks.  Specifically, our framework has two phases.
First, a base model using LSTM cells is pre-trained with a large amount of data (which were obtained
from a number of different stocks) to optimize initial training parameters. Secondly, the base model is
fine-tuned with a small amount of the target stock data to predict the target stock’s price movement.
    In detail, we first calculate a one-day return, which shows the change of a stock’s closing price
between two consecutive days. The first set of input features includes only one-day returns of the
COI stock. The second set is the combination of one-day returns of COI stock and the index (e.g.,
Korea Composite Stock Price Index 200 (KOSPI 200) and Standard&Poor’s 500 (S&P 500)). The third
set is the combination of one-day returns of the COI stock, the index, and stocks related to the COI
stock (i.e., the highest cosine similarity to the COI stock, similar field to the COI, and the highest
market capitalization).
    A lot of basic variables for stocks (e.g., high price, low price, closing price, volume, and
adjusted closing price) are considered as input features. Some basic factors (financial ratios,
technical indicators, macroeconomic indices, and competitors) should be used as important factors
affecting the rise and fall in stock values. When using TI as input, Experimental results showed
satisfactory prediction accuracy.
